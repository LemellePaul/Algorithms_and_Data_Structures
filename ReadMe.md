# Unemployment Data 

#### This project parses unemployment data to help illulstrate the benefits of using various data structures. The Sets branch creates a set data structure to show the benefits of using a set over an array. Going forward, I will branch the project to implement different data structures and search algorithms. 

#### NOTE: The employment data JSON is thanks to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

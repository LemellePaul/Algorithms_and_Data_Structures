# Unemployment Data 

#### This project parses unemployment data to help illulstrate the benefits of using various data structures. The BinarySearch branch creates three algorithms: Binary Search, Selection Sort, and QuikSort. A Binary Search requires a sorted collection, added Selection Sort (slow algorithm) and QuickSort (faster) to show the differences in sorting algorithms. Going forward, I will branch the project to implement different data structures and search algorithms.

# Unemployment Data 

#### This project parses unemployment data to a simple array to perform a linear search.  Going forward, I will branch the project to implement different data structures and search algorithms. 

#### NOTE: The employment data JSON is thanks to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

## Running the Projet
### Option 1:
`Run the code straight from XCode`

### Option 2:
1. `Build the project`
2. `Place the 'result.json' file in the same folder as the execuitable.`
3. `Run the following via a command line: ./UnemploymentData result.json.`
